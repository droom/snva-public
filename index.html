            <p class="para">South Norwood is home to our much-adored Brutalist library on Lawrence Road, saved in 2021 by local campaigning. Due to brutal cuts, it is now only open two days a week, and long-term underfunding means the range of books has stayed quite similar to when I was a child. Further afield, Croydon Central Library remains fantastic, but is a bus-ride away and its underfunding is also clear.</p>

Despite this being sourced from research conducted pre-pandemic, the makeup of the high street(s) remains similar. Amina Malik Gallery ran as a gallery space but repositioned as a perfume retailer in 2021. Amina’s lettering can still be seen adorning the walls of the venue. I will try to get in touch with both Elizabeth and Amina, as they’ll both have lots of insights for me to build upon.</p>

            <p class="para">Art and design has had such a positive impact on my life, raising my horizons from a very young age. With the support, encouragement, and guidance of many art teachers (in particular, those at Croydon School of Art), I was able to enter the digital design profession, in which I have been practising for 16+ years. I would like to make accessible the things I have learned to those outside formal art education, with learning pathways into formal study and/or mentoring to enter the industry, should they wish to pursue it. For this, it will be important to create an environment in which learning can take place.</p>

            <h5 class="h5">Reference Library</h5>
            <p class="para">Art and design books are often prohibitively expensive, meaning access to them may only happen within formal design education or when already in the industry. The reference library will first be populated by books I own, and ones I can source from my networks. For books I don’t have but deem to be a good addition, I’ll write to each publisher, being specific about why it would benefit patrons.</p>
            <p class="para">To make the library more accessible, and to aid research, an index of books the library has will be made available online, annotated with excerpts. A QR code within the library window will point to this. In phase two of the project, I would like to introduce a borrowing system.</p>

            <p class="para">18A is situated right by a popular, unsheltered bus stop. Commuters would be able to browse and get inspired whilst they wait for their carriage to arrive.</p>
            <p class="para">There is a lot of warmth for this building on community groups, and it would be fantastic to have this restored as a space in which everyone is welcome. I love the poetry of this once being a staple of working-class communities, now in service to local working-class people.</p>

            <p class="para">I was born in 1983 at Mayday Hospital and raised in South Norwood, spending most of my life here, and returning in 2020. I think everyone’s worlds got smaller during the pandemic and walking the same streets I grew up in made me reflect on what community means to me. My vision for South Norwood is of a high street people are proud of, feel part of, and take care of. A beautiful, urban market-town. I am biased, but there’s no place else like South Norwood.</p>
